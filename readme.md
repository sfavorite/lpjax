# Laravel - pjax demo

This is a simple Laravel appliction using pjax. It uses the bootstrap and bootstrap menus (nav). The 'home' and 'about' menu
items are pjax enabled but the 'Pjax - Laravel' link will cause a full reload. On the home page there are two links one for a
random picture the other a random number. When clicked these will use pjax.
